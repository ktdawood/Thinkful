Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

First let's analyze the different variables in our dataset: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment
Let's select 'Utilities' as our target variable for our KNN model.
Next, let's use normalization to compare the different utility bills by creating bounds of data to 0 and 1. Since we are trying to determine if the individuals pay their bill on time, we need to create bounds and rank them according to their frequency of paying. For instance, we could put a score of 1 for those who pay their bills before the 15th day of they billing period. 
To check our accuracy, let's calculate the z-score of our data.
